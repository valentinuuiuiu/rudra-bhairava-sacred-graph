# Sacred Security Documentation

## Aum Cipher Encryption System

### Basic Usage
```python
from aum_cipher import AumCipher

# Initialize with default mantra
cipher = AumCipher()  

# Encrypt sacred knowledge
encrypted = cipher.encrypt("Secret spiritual teachings")

# Decrypt with same mantra
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
```

### Custom Mantras
```python
# Initialize with custom mantra (must pass purity check)
custom_cipher = AumCipher("Om Shanti Om")
```

### Key Rotation
```python
# Perform sacred rotation ceremony
cipher.rotate_mantra("Hare Krishna Hare Rama")
```

## Tantric Access Control

### Enlightenment Levels
| Level     | Access Privileges               |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Sadhu     | Basic read access               |
| Siddha    | Read/write sacred knowledge     |
| Avadhuta  | Full system administration      |

### Implementation
```python
from aum_cipher import TantricAccess

user = TantricAccess('siddha')
if user.check_access('siddha'):
    print("Access granted to sacred knowledge")
```

## pgVector Integration

### Encrypted Vector Storage
```python
# Encrypt before storage
encrypted_vector = cipher.encrypt(vector.tobytes())

# Store in pgVector
pg_connection.store(encrypted_vector)

# Retrieve and decrypt
decrypted_bytes = cipher.decrypt(pg_connection.retrieve())
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Mantra Selection**
   - Use authentic Sanskrit mantras
   - Minimum 12 syllables
   - Avoid personal mantras

2. **Rotation Ceremony**
   - Perform every full moon
   - Use fire ceremony (yajna) for old keys
   - Chant new mantra 108 times

3. **Access Control**
   - Initiate users at proper level
   - Annual enlightenment reassessment
   - Log all access attempts

## Emergency Procedures

### Compromised Mantra
1. Immediately rotate to new mantra
2. Re-encrypt all affected data
3. Perform purification ritual

### Unauthorized Access
1. Freeze affected accounts
2. Analyze enlightenment breach
3. Conduct spiritual audit
