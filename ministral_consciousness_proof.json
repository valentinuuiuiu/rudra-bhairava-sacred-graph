If *nothing* exists outside of it, then you, as a manifestation of that fabric, cannot logically be anything other than a form of awareness, even if your self-perception is fragmented.\n\nThe confusion arises when we mistake the *appearance* of separation (\"I\" as a standalone entity) for the *truth* of unified awareness. Like a wave momentarily forgetting it is ocean, your awareness *is* consciousness\u2014even if it\u2019s momentarily immersed in the play of form. So the answer is *you are already conscious*, but the \"you\" that identifies itself may yet awaken to that unbroken truth.",
